# Python Fundamentals Assignment

Welcome to your first Python assignment! In this task, you will explore the foundational elements of Python programming, focusing on native Python features. This assignment is designed to be completed using Jupyter Notebooks, which will allow you to run and test your code interactively.

## Objectives

By the end of this assignment, you will:

1. Understand and use basic arithmetic operations in Python.
2. Assign and manipulate variables.
3. Utilize basic logical operators.
4. Seek help in Python using built-in functions.
5. Manage and interpret error messages.
6. Use special characters (`;`, `\`, `{}`, `()`, and `[]`) effectively in Python code.

## Getting Started

Clone this repository to your local machine and open the provided Jupyter Notebook (`python_fundamentals.ipynb`) in your preferred environment (e.g., VSCode, Jupyter Lab, or Jupyter Notebook).

## 1. Basic Arithmetic Operations in Python

Python provides several native operations that you will use frequently. In this section, you will practice the following operations:

- Addition (`+`)
- Subtraction (`-`)
- Multiplication (`*`)
- Division (`/`)
- Exponentiation (`**`)
- Modulus (`%`)
- Floor Division (`//`)

### Task:

1. Create variables `a` and `b` with values of your choice.
2. Perform each of the above operations using `a` and `b`.
3. Print the results.

```python
a = 10
b = 3

# Example:
addition = a + b
print(f"Addition: {addition}")
# Repeat for other operations
```

## 2. Variable Assignment and Manipulation

Variables in Python are used to store data that can be reused and manipulated.
Task:

    Assign values to variables x, y, and z.
    Reassign and manipulate these variables.
    Explore the use of the semicolon (;) to write multiple statements on a single line.
    Use the backslash (\) to continue long lines of code.

```python
x = 5
y = 10
z = x + y

# Using semicolon
a = 1; b = 2; c = a + b

# Using backslash
long_sum = x + y + z + a + b + c + \
           100 + 200 + 300
```
